# Travel Booking App Blueprint

## Overview

A comprehensive travel booking application that allows users to search and book flights, hotels, and cabs. The application also includes user authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their bookings through a personal dashboard.

*   **Layout:** The application follows a standard layout with a fixed navigation bar, a main content area, and a footer.
*   **Icons:** Material-UI Icons are used throughout the application to enhance usability.

    *   Search forms with relevant fields for each booking type.
*   **Navigation:**
    *   A responsive navigation bar with links to all major pages.
    *   A mobile-friendly drawer for navigation on smaller screens.
*   **Home Page:**
    *   A visually appealing hero section with a background image.
    *   A tabbed interface for easy access to flight, hotel, and cab booking forms.
